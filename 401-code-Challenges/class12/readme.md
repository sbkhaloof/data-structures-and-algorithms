## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
+ i undertand the problem first
+ I imagined how the results should be
+ I wrote the code: create class animal and class animel shelter , write the enqueue and dequeue method 
+ I made the tests and check it 

+ enqueue:
Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
+ dequeue:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
